I am a doctoral student in Public Health at the University of California, Irvine. My research interests include coping mechanisms for distress, dietary patterns, structural discrimination, and social determinants of mental health among immigrant populations. I am also passionate about suicide prevention, support networks, and interdisciplinary approaches to health equity.
